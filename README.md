For best results, run the program in full screen, other sizes are  partly supported, but might cause issues.

Vehicle rates are the same across all locations  and differ only by vehicle type, eg. Medium water is the same price in Nuuk and Longyearbyen.
They are changable by office employees and administrators, but not airport staff.

Locations' opening hours are an attribute of each location (destination). Opening hours are different for each location (but allows duplicates), 
meaning each location has its own opening hours.

Employees, customers and vehicles cannot be removed from the database through the program. Vehicles can be put in the workshop if they are unusable
Contracts can be terminated and this will remove them from the database.
